1. Master, slave and client need configuration files.
   i)  Put .GEmaster.config under home directory of master. The format should be:
       masterDataPath=...       /* Should be a directory containing client data. Will be created if not exist. */
       masterResultPath=...     /* Should be a directory containing result fetched from slaves. Will be created if not exist. */
       marsOutLocation=...      /* Should be the path of marsOut. Must be correct. */
       marsOutCtlLocation=...   /* Should be the path of marsOut control file. Must be correct. */
   ii) Put .GEslave.config under home directory of slave. The format should be:
       slaveDataPath=...        /* Should be a directory containing data fetched from master. Will be created if not exist. */
       marsMainLocation=...     /* Should be the path of marsMain. Must be correct. */
       marsMainCtlLocation=...  /* Should be the path of marsMain control file. Must be correct. */
   iii)Put .GEclient.config under home directory of client. The format should be:
       masterHost=...           /* Should be the host name of master. */

2. Master should have a file under its home directory named .nodeList.config. Put slave host name or IP address in it. One per line.

3. Master, slave should be executed on 64-bit Linux machines with JDK-1.6 installed. Client can be executed in either Windows or Linux based machines.
   i)  Start master. If you download the code from github. Go to bin and execute the following command. ./master.sh
   ii) Start slave.  If you download the code from github. Go to bin and execute the following command. ./slave.sh
   iii)Start client. If you download the code from github. Go to bin and execute the following command. ./client.sh
                     Note client.sh is for Linux. Command in it is basically the same for Windows. Will provide Windows version later.
                     In client.sh, you need to provide the Input file directory or path and output directory. Also, the replication number and node number.
                     May provide GUI if had time...
